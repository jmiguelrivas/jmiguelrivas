**Salishan** is a **keyboard layout for Salishan and neighboring Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest**. It extends the standard English keyboard with **dead keys for glottalization, acute accent, tilde, and other diacritics**, enabling efficient typing of **ejective, glottalized, and lateral consonants**, as well as **special vowels** used across multiple Salishan languages. The layout also includes **combining diacritics for rare tonal or phonetic markings**, making it a comprehensive tool for **linguists, language learners, and community members**.

A lightweight 3D house visualizer built entirely with modern CSS and a bit of nested structure for clarity. It began as an experiment in recreating a simple architectural scene, but quickly grew into a full mini-environment with walls, roof, chimney, base, fence, and ground. The project uses pure CSS 3D transforms, no frameworks, libraries, or external rendering tools to generate depth, perspective, and animation, resulting in a clean, self-contained visual demo.

A lightweight visualizer built with native Web Components and SVG, created as a refactor of a previous project that originally used Vue.js, Blender, and Konva. The original version started as a Google Maps-based app showing the cities where I’ve lived, studied, or worked. But as the map grew too large and visually restrictive, the project evolved into a custom-designed world.

</summary>


![Bounce Preview](img/og-preview-research_bounce.webp)

This project aims to simplify how bouncing animations are calculated by removing the need for traditional conditional checks when an object reaches the edges of the screen. Instead, it uses a continuous filtering approach that naturally reverses direction, creating a smooth bounce effect without explicit boundary conditions. This technique can be applied to any scenario where an element needs to rebound (such as a ball moving around the screen or other looping, oscillating animations) making the underlying motion logic cleaner, more elegant, and easier to reuse in different programs.
