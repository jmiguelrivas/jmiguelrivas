ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel Rivas.

Passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on building custom web applications mostly using Vue2 and Vue3 with deep knowledge about Web Components.

With years of experience across various industries, I've contributed to UI libraries, optimized performance, and collaborated closely with cross functional teams to deliver seamless user experiences. My expertise includes modern frontend frameworks, component-driven development, and testing methodologies using tools like Storybook and Vitest.

ðŸŽ¨ Here is a link to my [Portfolio 2025][website].
> In this portfolio Vue, React, and Angular have been replaced with Web Components. Because of this, you will be able to see the full structure when inspecting elements on the document.
