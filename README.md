**Salishan** is a **keyboard layout for Salishan and neighboring Indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest**. It extends the standard English keyboard with **dead keys for glottalization, acute accent, tilde, and other diacritics**, enabling efficient typing of **ejective, glottalized, and lateral consonants**, as well as **special vowels** used across multiple Salishan languages. The layout also includes **combining diacritics for rare tonal or phonetic markings**, making it a comprehensive tool for **linguists, language learners, and community members**.

[![3D Visualizer Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3d-visualizer/3d-visualizer.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/visualizer-preview.webp)](https://3d-visualizer.github.io/?play)

A lightweight visualizer built with native Web Components and SVG, created as a refactor of a previous project that originally used Vue.js, Blender, and Konva. The original version started as a Google Maps-based app showing the cities where I’ve lived, studied, or worked. But as the map grew too large and visually restrictive, the project evolved into a custom-designed world.
